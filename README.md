# Switt

Tool Kit for reading Swift code

# Welcome to Switt project.

Switt is a framework for reading Swift files into nice structures and generating nice code from these structures. It is in a very early stage of development, however, every contribution is welcomed.

The project is under MIT license. The project is non-profit.

This project is only used in the boilerplate-free mock framework I've recently released to public (it's still unusable):
- Framework: https://github.com/SwiftTools/Swick
- Generator: https://github.com/SwiftTools/SwickGen

This project uses ANTLRv4 and my framework with Swift grammar: https://github.com/SwiftTools/SwiftGrammar
