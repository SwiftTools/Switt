# Switt

Tool Kit for reading Swift code

# Welcome to Switt project.

Switt is a framework for reading Swift files into nice structures and generating nice code from these structures. It is in a very early stage of development, however, every contribution is welcomed.

The project is under MIT license. The project is non-profit.

Originally I've started mock generating project like Cuckoo, which is now not ready, because of lack of tools.

# How to build

This project has no examples and has no practical usage yet. However, if you decide to participate, here's howto:

1. ```carthage update --platform osx  --no-use-binaries```
1. Open xcodeproj
1. Run tests
