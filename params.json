{"name":"Switt","tagline":"Tool Kit for reading Swift code","body":"### Welcome to Switt project.\r\nSwitt is a framework for reading Swift files into nice structures and generating nice code from these structures. It is in a very early stage of development, however, every contribution is welcomed.\r\n\r\nI doubt if anyone will read this site and support this project, so I will keep this web page a little bit messy.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n1. Commit changes with code generation if anyone else is interested in this project\r\n1. Implement type inference\r\n1. Implement scanning generic placeholders from String (SourceKit doesn't provide such information =( )\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact me via skype: artyomrazinov (with a dot between m and r), or mail @gmail.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
