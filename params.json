It is in a very early stage of development, however, every contribution is welcomed.\r\n\r\nThe project is under MIT license. The project is non-profit.\r\n\r\nOriginally I've started mock generating project like Cuckoo, which is now not ready, because of lack of tools.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the project has already Source Kit integration and home made lexical analyzer. See example: http://pastebin.com/xvFWnhFC\r\n\r\n# Help this project\r\n\r\nIf you like this project, you can:\r\n\r\n1. Write tests\r\n1. Improve performance\r\n1. Go deep into code and do complex changes\r\n\r\n# History of development\r\n\r\n1. Mar 8: Initial commits, simple scanning for declarations with SourceKitten (I also made helper project SwiftFelisCatus)\r\n1. Mar 13: I realized that Source Kit can't provide some info and has errors and I moved towards implementing lexical analysis. I made simple grammar and parser.\r\n1. Mar 21: I read Dragon Book and realized that I was completely wrong. I implement proper lexer that tokenizes character stream\r\n1. Mar 30: Finished parser. Implement transformations of grammar. Faced with the problem with performance. It is really slow, but it is enough to start developing other parts of code\r\n\r\n# Plans\r\n\r\n1. Implement scanning declarations into nice struct with Source Kit and with a help of previously made lexical analyzer.\r\n1. Start developing mock framework\r\n1. Maybe to improve performance at this stage, if I can find free time.\r\n1. After mock framework will be stable I will improve performance.\r\n1. I have an idea to create structs for syntax tree. E.g.: you want to handle about 10 cases of declarations, not all 253 rules. So you want a nice enum with only 10 cases for declarations. This can be done using code generation. \r\n\r\n# Support or Contact\r\n\r\nContact me via skype: artyom(d-o-t)razinov, or mail artyom(d-o-t)razinov@gmail.com\r\n",
